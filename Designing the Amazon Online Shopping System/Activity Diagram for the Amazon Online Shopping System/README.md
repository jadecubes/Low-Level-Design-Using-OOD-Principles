# Activity Diagram for the Amazon Online Shopping System
Activities diagrams are a great way to visualize the flow of messages from one activity to the other in the system. There can be different activity diagrams that we can create for our Amazon online shopping system. In this lesson, we will create activity diagrams for the following two activities:

- A customer buying a product

- Activity challenge: The customer receives their order.
