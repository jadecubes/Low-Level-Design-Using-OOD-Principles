# Requirements for the Amazon Online Shopping System
In this lesson, we’ll list the requirements of our Amazon online shopping system. This is a very crucial step as requirements define the scope of a problem. Therefore, getting them right from the interviewer and understanding them well will make the design of the rest of the system smooth and easy.

We’ll use the notational convention to identify each requirement with a unique label "Rn", where "R" is short for Requirement and "n" is a natural number.

## Requirement collection
The requirements for the Amazon online shopping system design problem are defined below:

R1: A customer can either be an authenticated user or a guest. The authenticated user is one with a registered account on the Amazon online shopping system, whereas a guest does not have a registered account.

R2: An authenticated user should be able to buy, sell, and search the products via the product name or category. A guest is only able to search for products.

R3: A product can have multiple reviews and ratings from multiple customers.

R4: An authenticated user should be able to add, remove, or modify product items in their shopping cart. The authenticated user can further check out and buy the items.

R5: The authenticated user should be able to specify a shipping address at the time of order.

R6: Payment can be made through credit cards, electronic bank transfers, or through cash on delivery.

R7: An order can be canceled, only in the case that it hasn’t been shipped.

R8: Notifications are sent whenever there is a change in the order or shipping status.

R9: Shipment can be tracked to see the current status and the estimated time of arrival for the order.

R10: An admin should exist that can add, modify, or remove product categories and block users.

We’ve identified our requirements for the problem, and in the next lesson, we will define different use cases of our Amazon online shopping system.
