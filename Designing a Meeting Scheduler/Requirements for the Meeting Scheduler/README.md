# Requirements for the Meeting Scheduler
In this lesson, we'll list the requirements of the meeting scheduler. This is a very crucial step, since requirements define the scope of a problem, so getting them right from the interviewer and understanding them well will make the design of the rest of the system smooth and easy.

Weâ€™ll use the notational convention to identify each requirement with a unique label "Rn", where "R" is short for Requirement and "n" is a natural number.

## Requirement collection
The requirements for the meeting scheduler design problem are defined below:

R1: There should be an n number of meeting rooms.

R2: Each meeting room should have a specific capacity to accommodate the desired number of people.

R3: If not reserved already, each meeting room should have the ability to be booked, along with setting an interval, a start time, and an end time for the meeting.

R4: A notification should be sent to all the people invited to the meeting.

R5: Users will receive an invite regardless of whether they are available at the interval or not. Users can respond to the invitation by either accepting or rejecting the invite.

R6: Each user should have access to a calendar that is used to track the date and time, as well as to schedule or cancel meetings.

We've identified our requirements for the problem, and in the next lesson, we will define different use cases for the meeting scheduler.
