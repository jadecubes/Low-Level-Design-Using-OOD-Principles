# Activity Diagram for the Meeting Scheduler
Activity diagrams are a great way to visualize the flow of messages from one activity to the other in the system. There can be different activity diagrams that we can create for our meeting scheduler. In this lesson, we will create activity diagrams for the following two activities:

- Schedule a meeting

- Activity challenge: Respond to an invite

## Schedule meeting
The following states and actions will be involved in this activity diagram.


### States
Initial state: The user opens the calendar.

Final state: The notification and meeting details are sent to all the invited participants.
### Actions
The user opens the calendar and selects an available slot. The user books a meeting room and the meeting details are sent to all invited users.

You'll help us to create an activity diagram of a person responding to an invite.

A skeleton of the activity diagram is given below:
