# Code for the Airline Management System
We’ve reviewed different aspects of the airline management system and observed the attributes attached to the problem using various UML diagrams. Let’s explore the more practical side of things, where we will work on implementing the airline management system using multiple languages. This is usually the last step in an object-oriented design interview process.

We have chosen the following languages to write the skeleton code of the different classes present in the airline management system:

- Java

- C#

- Python

- C++

- JavaScript

## The airline management system classes
In this section, we’ll provide the skeleton code of the classes designed in the class diagram lesson.
```
Note: For simplicity, we are not defining getter and setter functions. The reader can assume that all class attributes are private and accessed through their respective public getter methods and modified only through their public methods function.
```

### Constants
The following code provides the definition of the various enums and custom data types being used in the airline management system:
```
Note: JavaScript does not support enumerations, so we will be using the Object.freeze() method as an alternative that freezes an object and prevents further modifications.
```

### Account and passenger
### Person
### Seat and flight seat
### Flight and flight instance
### Itinerary and flight reservation
### Payment
### Notification
### Search and catalog
### Airport, aircraft, and airline
## Wrapping up
