# Requirements for the Airline Management System
In this lesson, we’ll list the requirements of the airline management system. This is a very crucial step, because requirements define the scope of a problem. Therefore, getting them right from the interviewer and understanding them well will make the design of the rest of the system smooth and easy.

We’ll use the notational convention to identify each requirement with a unique label, "Rn" where "R" is short for Requirement and "n" is a natural number.


## Requirements collection
The requirements for the airline management system are defined below:

R1: A customer should be able to search for flights by the date, departure, and destination airport.

R2: A customer should be able to reserve tickets for available flights. Customers should also be able to book multiple flights at once.

R3: The customer should be allowed to book multiple seats for a single flight.

R4: The system should allow the customer to check flight details, such as available seats, flight schedules, and departure/arrival times.

R5: The admin should be able to add new flights. The admin should be able to update or cancel scheduled flights.

R6: An airline should be able to own multiple aircrafts. The admin should be able to add these aircrafts to the system.

R7: An airline should be able to operate its flights from different airports.

R8: The admin should be able to assign pilots and crew members to flights effectively.

R9: The customer should be able to make payments against their flight reservations.

R10: The customer should be able to cancel their previous reservations.

R11: The front desk officer should be able to reserve tickets, create itineraries, and make flight payments for the customer.

R12: The flight crew should be able to view the schedule for their assigned flights.

R13: The system should send the customer a notification whenever a reservation has been made or canceled or when there is an update for their flight.

We've identified our requirements for the problem. In the next lesson, we will define different use cases of the airline management system.
