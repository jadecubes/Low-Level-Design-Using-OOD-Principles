# Class Diagram for Cricinfo
In this lesson, we’ll identify and design the classes, abstract classes, and interfaces based on the requirements we have previously gathered from the interviewer in our Cricinfo system.

## Components of Cricinfo
As mentioned earlier, we will design the Cricinfo system using a bottom-up approach.

### Admin
The Admin class is responsible for managing the system as well as adding and modifying updates. The representation of the class is shown below:

[The Admin class](./admin.png)

```
R8: The admin of the system should be able to add tournaments, matches, teams, players, and news to the system.
```

### Run, ball, and wicket
The Run class records the number and type of runs scored on a ball. The Ball class records every detail of a ball, such as the number of runs scored, if it was a wicket-taking ball, etc. The Wicket class records the details of the wicket, including its type, the player that bowled, and the player that was declared out.

The mentioned classes are shown below:

[The Run, Ball, and Wicket classes](./run.ball.wicket.png)

```
R2: The system should be able to track all scores or wickets that occurred for each ball. The system should also provide a live commentary for every ball.
```
### Over and innings
The Over class represents all the details of an over of the innings. The Innings class represents the details of a match innings. The two classes are shown below:

[The Over and Innings classes](./over.innings.png)

### Match
The Match class is an abstract class that has three child classes that represent the types of matches that can take place.

- The Test class

- The ODI class

- The T20 class

The class diagram is shown below:

[The Match and its derived classes](./match.png)

```
R3: The system should be able to keep track of all matches—Test, T20, and ODI matches.
```

### Stadium
The Stadium class represents the information about a stadium, including its name, address, and capacity. The UML representation of this class is given below:

[The Stadium class](./statium.png)

### Player, coach, and umpire
The Player class includes the information of a player and their statistics. The Coach class contains the information of a coach. The Umpire class contains the information of an umpire. The three classes are shown below:

[The Player, Coach, and Umpire classes](./player.coach.umpire.png)

```
R1: The system should be able to track the stats of all players, teams, and matches.
```

### Team, tournament squad, and playing eleven
The Team class represents the information about a cricket team, including the list of players, the team coach, and any news related to the team.

The TournamentSquad class represents the team members participating in a tournament. The Playing11 class represents the squad members playing in a match.

The class diagram for these classes is given below:

[The Team, TournamentSquad, and Playing11 classes](./team.tornamentsquad.png)

```
R6: All teams should be able to select some players that will participate in the tournament.

R7: For every match, the teams must select 11 players to play on the field, known as the playing eleven.
```

### Tournament and points table
The Tournament class contains information about a cricket tournament. The PointsTable class shows the accumulated points and match results of the teams that play in the tournament. These classes are shown below:

[The Tournament and PointsTable classes](./tornament.pointstable.png)

```
R4: The system should be able to keep track of ongoing and previous tournaments. The system should also be able to show a points table for all teams participating in a tournament.
```
### Stats
The Stat class is an abstract class that extends to PlayerStat, TeamStat, and MatchStat classes. These classes contain important statistics. The UML representation is shown below:

[Stat and its derived classes](./stat.png)

```
R1: The system should be able to track the stats of all players, teams, and matches.

R5: The system should be able to show the result of all previous televised matches.
```


### Commentator and commentary
The Commentator class records the information about the commentator. The Commentary class contains information about the commentary for every ball of an over. The two classes are shown below:

[The Commentator and Commentary classes](./commentator.commentary.png)

```
R2: The system should be able to track all scores or wickets that occurred for each ball. The system should also provide a live commentary for every ball.
```

### News
The News class holds the news updates of a team. The definition of this class is given below:

[The News class](./news.png)

### Enumerations
The enumerations required in the Cricinfo system are listed below:

- MatchResult: This records the result of a match— a win, loss, canceled, or drawn.

- UmpireType: This records the type of umpire—field umpire, third umpire, or reserved.

- WicketType: This records the type of the wicket—stumped, bold, caught, etc.

- BallType: This records the type of ball played—a regular delivery, wide, no ball, or wicket.

- RunType: This records the type of run scored—a regular run, four, six, wide, etc.

- PlayingPosition: This records the playing position of a player—batsman, bowler, and all-rounder.

### Custom data type
We need to create a custom data type, Address, that will store the physical location of any place.

## Relationship between classes
Now, we will discuss the relationships between the classes we have defined above in our Cricinfo system.

### Association
The class diagram has the following association relationships:

#### One-way association
The Admin class has a one-way association with the Player, Team, Match, and Tournament classes.

The Player class has a one-way association with the Run, Ball, Wicket, and Over classes.

The Team class has a one-way association with the TournamentSquad and Tournament classes.

The TournamentSquad class has a one-way association with the Playing11 class.

#### Two-way association
The Ball class is associated with the Run, Wicket, and Commentary classes.

The Team class is associated with the Coach and News classes.

The Commentary class is associated with the Commentator class.

The Match class is associated with the Umpire, Commentator, and Stadium classes.

### Aggregation
The class diagram has the following aggregation relationships:

- The Tournament class contains the TournamentSquad class.

### Composition
The class diagram has the following composition relationships:

The Player class is composed of the PlayerStat class.

The Team class is composed of the Player and TeamStat classes.

The Tournament class is composed of the Match and PointsTable classes.

The Match class is composed of the Playing11, Innings, and MatchStat classes.

The Innings class is composed of the Over class.

The Over class is composed of the Ball class.

### Inheritance
The class diagram has the following inheritance relationships:

The ODI, Test, and T20 classes are derived from the Match class.

The TeamStat, MatchStat, and PlayerStat classes are derived from the Stat class.
```
Note: We have already discussed the inheritance relationship between classes in the component section above one by one.

## Design pattern
In the Cricinfo system, we need to create different types of matches, tournaments, and squads at runtime. To do this, we can use the Factory design pattern. This pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

We have completed the class diagram of Cricinfo according to the requirements. Now, let’s design the sequence diagram of Cricinfo in the next lesson.
