# Sequence Diagram
Sequence diagrams are a great way to understand the interactions between different entities and objects in the system. There can be different sequence diagrams that we can create for the Cricinfo system. In this lesson, we will create a sequence diagram for the following interaction:

- Add a match: The admin adds a new match to the system.

## Add a match
The sequence diagram for adding a match should have the following actors and objects that will interact with each other:

- Actors: Admin, Umpire, and Commentator

- Objects: Match and Stadium

The steps involved in adding a match are listed below:

1. The admin creates a new match of a specific match type.

2. The admin adds the playing teams for the match.

3. The admin assigns a stadium to the match.

4. The admin assigns an umpire to the match.

5. The admin assigns a commentator to the match.

Based on the order above, the sequence diagram for adding a match in the Cricinfo system is provided below:
