# Requirements for Cricinfo
In this lesson, we’ll list the requirements of Cricinfo. This is a very crucial step, since requirements define the scope of a problem. Therefore, getting them right from the interviewer and understanding them well will make the design of the rest of the system smooth and easy.

We’ll use the notational convention to identify each requirement with a unique label, "Rn" where "R" is short for Requirement and "n" is a natural number.

## Requirements collection
The requirements for Cricinfo are defined below:

R1: The system should be able to track the stats of all players, teams, and matches.

R2: The system should be able to track all scores or wickets that occurred for each ball. The system should also provide a live commentary for every ball.

R3: The system should be able to keep track of all matches—Test, T20, and ODI matches.

R4: The system should be able to keep track of ongoing and previous tournaments. The system should also be able to show a points table for all teams participating in a tournament.

R5: The system should be able to show the result of all previous televised matches.

R6: All teams should be able to select some players that will participate in the tournament.

R7: For every match, the teams should be able to select 11 players to play on the field, known as the playing eleven.

R8: The admin of the system should be able to add tournaments, matches, teams, players, and news to the system.

We've identified our requirements for the problem. In the next lesson, we will define different use cases of Cricinfo.
