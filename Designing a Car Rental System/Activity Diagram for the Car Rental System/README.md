# Activity Diagram for the Car Rental System

Activities diagrams are a great way to visualize the flow of messages from one activity to the other in the system. There can be different activity diagrams that we can create for our car rental system. In this lesson, we will create activity diagrams for the following two activities:

- Vehicle pickup

- Activity challenge: Vehicle return

## Vehicle pickup
The states and actions that will be involved in this activity diagram are given below.

### States
Initial state: A member with a vehicle booking comes to the rent-a-car reception to pick up the vehicle.

Final state: The guest either successfully gets the vehicle or the system shows a reservation error.


### Actions
The member with a vehicle reservation arrives at the rent-a-car reception. The receptionist validates the reservation and updates the vehicle status.

Based on the order above, the activity diagram of the vehicle pickup from the car rental facility is given below.
