# Code for the Car Rental System
We’ve reviewed different aspects of the car rental system and observed the attributes attached to the problem using various UML diagrams. Let’s explore the more practical side of things, where we will work on implementing the car rental system using multiple languages. This is usually the last step in an object-oriented design interview process.

We have chosen the following languages to write the skeleton code of the different classes present in the car rental system:

- Java

- C#

- Python

- C++

- JavaScript

## Car rental system classes
In this section, we will provide the skeleton code of the classes designed in the class diagram lesson.
```
Note: For simplicity, we are not defining getter and setter functions. The reader can assume that all class attributes are private and accessed through their respective public getter methods and modified only through their public methods function.
```
### Enumerations
First, we will define all the enumerations required in the car rental system. According to the class diagram, there are seven enumerations used in the system, i.e., VehicleStatus, AccountStatus, ReservationStatus, PaymentStatus, VanType, CarType, and VehicleLogType. The code to implement these enumerations is as follows:
```
Note: JavaScript does not support enumerations, so we will use the Object.freeze() method as an alternative that freezes an object and prevents further modifications.
```

```java
// definition of enumerations used in the car rental system
enum VehicleStatus {
  AVAILABLE,
  RESERVED, 
  LOST, 
  BEING_SERVICED
}

enum AccountStatus {
  ACTIVE, 
  CLOSED, 
  CANCELED, 
  BLACKLISTED, 
  BLOCKED
}

enum ReservationStatus {
  ACTIVE, 
  PENDING, 
  CONFIRMED, 
  COMPLETED, 
  CANCELED
}

enum PaymentStatus {
  UNPAID, 
  PENDING, 
  COMPLETED,  
  CANCELED,  
  REFUNDED
}

enum VanType {

}

}

enum VehicleLogType {

  OIL_CHANGE, 
  REPAIR, 
  OTHER
}

### Address, person, and driver
This section contains the Address, Person, and Driver classes, where the first two classes are used as a custom data type. The implementation of these classes is shown below:se classes can be found below:

```java
public class Address {
  private String streetAddress;
  private String city;
  private String state;
  private int zipCode;
  private String country;
}

public class Person {
  private String name;
  private Address address;
  private String email;

```

```c#

class Driver(Person):
  def __init__(self, name, address, email, phone_number, driver_id):
    super().__init__(name, address, email, phone_number)
    self.__driver_id = driver_id
```

```c++

```

### Account
Account is an abstract class that represents the various people or actors that can interact with the system. There are two types of accounts: receptionist and customer. The implementation of Account and its subclasses is shown below:

```java
public abstract class Account extends Person {
    private String accountId;
    private String password;
    private AccountStatus status;

    public abstract boolean resetPassword();
}

public class Receptionist extends Account {
    private Date dateJoined;

    public List<Customer> searchCustomer(String name);
    public boolean addReservation();
    public boolean cancelReservation();
    public boolean resetPassword() {
        // definition
    }
}

public class Customer extends Account {
    private String licenseNumber;
    private Date licenseExpiry;

    public boolean addReservation();
    public boolean cancelReservation();
    public List<VehicleReservation> getReservations();
    public boolean resetPassword() {
        // definition
    }
}
```

    private int price;
}

class DriverService : Service {
    private int driverId;
}

class RoadsideAssistance : Service {
}

class WiFi : Service {

## Wrapping up
We've explored the complete design of a car rental system in this chapter. We've looked at how a basic car rental system can be visualized using various UML diagrams and designed using object-oriented principles and design patterns.
