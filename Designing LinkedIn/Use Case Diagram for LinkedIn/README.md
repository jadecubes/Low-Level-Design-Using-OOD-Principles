# Use Case Diagram for LinkedIn
Let's build the use case diagram of LinkedIn and understand the relationship between its different components.

First, we’ll define the different elements of our LinkedIn system, followed by the complete use case diagram of the system.

### Secondary actors
System: This is responsible for sending out notifications for new connection requests, messages, comments, posts, recommendations, etc.

## Use cases
In this section, we’ll define the use cases for LinkedIn. We have listed the use cases according to their respective interactions with a particular actor.

## Relationships
This section describes the relationships between and among actors and their use cases.

### Generalization
- The user can add/update their profile by either adding or updating their education, experience, skill, or achievement. This shows that the “Add/update profile” use case has a generalization relationship with “Add/update education,” “Add/update experience,” “Add/update skill,” and “Add/update achievement” use cases.

### Associations
The table below shows the association relationship between actors and their use cases.
```

### Include
- The “Send message” use case has an include relationship with the “Message notification” use case, because whenever a user receives a message, the user is notified.

- The “Send connection invitation” use case has an include relationship with the “Connection invitation notification” use case. Whenever a user receives the connection invitation, the system notifies the user.

- When the user accepts the recommendation request, the system adds that recommendation in the user's profile. Therefore, the “Accept recommendation” use case has an include relationship with the “Add recommendation” use case.

- The “Add/share post" use case has an include relationship with the “New post notification.” Whenever a user creates a post or shares it, the system notifies the connected users.

- The “Comment on post/comment” use case has an include relationship with the “New comment notification” use case. Whenever a new comment is made by another user on a post either created by the default user or followed by the default user, the system notifies the default user.

- The “Request recommendation” use case has an include relationship with the “Recommendation notification” use case. Whenever a user gets a recommendation request, the system notifies the user.

### Extend
- When users get the recommendation request, they can either accept or delete the request. Therefore, the “Request recommendation” use case has an extend relationship with the “Accept recommendation” and "Delete recommendation" use cases.

- Whenever the users get a connection invitation request, they can either accept or ignore the request. Therefore, the “Send connection invitation” use case has an extend relationship with the “Accept/ignore connection invitation” use case.
