# Code for LinkedIn
We've gone over the different aspects of LinkedIn and observed the attributes attached to the problem using various UML diagrams. Letâ€™s explore the more practical side of things, where we will work on implementing the LinkedIn network using multiple languages. This is usually the last step in an object-oriented design interview process.

We have chosen the following languages to write the skeleton code of the different classes present in LinkedIn:

- Java

- C#

- Python

- C++

- JavaScript

## LinkedIn classes
In this section, we will provide the skeleton code of the classes designed in the class diagram lesson.
```
Note: For simplicity, we are not defining getter and setter functions. The reader can assume that all class attributes are private and accessed through their respective public getter methods and modified only through their public method functions.
```
### Constants
The following code provides the definition of the various enums and custom data types being used in the LinkedIn design:
```
Note: JavaScript does not support enumerations so we will be using the Object.freeze() method as an alternative that freezes an object and prevents further modifications.
```
### Account
### Person, admin, and user
### Recommendation, achievement, and analytics
### Profile, experience, education, and skill
### Company, job, and group
### Post, comment, message, and connection invitation
### Search, catalog, and notification
## Wrapping up
