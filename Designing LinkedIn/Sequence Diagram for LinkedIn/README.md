# Sequence Diagram for LinkedIn
Sequence diagrams are a great way to understand the interactions between different entities and objects in the system. There can be different sequence diagrams that we can create for LinkedIn. In this lesson, weâ€™ll create sequence diagrams for the following interaction:

- Send a connection invitation: A user sends a connection invitation to another user.

## Send a connection invitation
The sequence diagram for sending a connection invitation should have the following actors and objects that will interact with each other:

- Actors: UserA and UserB

- Objects: SearchCatalog and ConnectionInvitation

Here are the steps for the send a connection invitation interaction:
1. User A searches for user B in the catalog.

2. If User B exists:

    I. The catalog returns user B.

    II. User A adds user B as a connection.

    III. The connection invitation is sent to user B.

    IV. If the invitation is accepted:

        i. User B is added to user A's connections.

        ii. User A gets a notification that the connection invitation has been accepted.

    V. Else, the invitation is ignored.

3. Else, if user B does not exist:

I. User A receives a "user not found" error.

Based on the order above, the sequence diagram for sending a connection invitation on LinkedIn is given below:
