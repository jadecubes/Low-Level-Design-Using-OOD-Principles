# Activity Diagram for LinkedIn
Activity diagrams are a great way to visualize the flow of messages from one activity to the other in the system. There can be different activity diagrams that we can create for LinkedIn. In this lesson, we’ll create activity diagrams for the following two activities:

- Creating a new post

- Activity challenge: A user creates a page.

## Creating a new post
The states and actions that will be involved in this activity diagram are provided below.

### States
Initial state: The user selects the new post option.

Final state: The post is published.

### Actions
The user selects the new post option, selects the privacy option, adds any attachments, and publishes the post.
