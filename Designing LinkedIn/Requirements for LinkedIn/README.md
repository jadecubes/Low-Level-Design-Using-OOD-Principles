# Requirements for LinkedIn
In this lesson, we’ll list the requirements of the LinkedIn design problem. This is a crucial step because requirements define the scope of a problem. Therefore, getting them right from the interviewer and understanding them well will make the design of the rest of the system smooth and easy.

We’ll use the notational convention to identify each requirement with a unique label, "Rn" where "R" is short for Requirement and "n" is a natural number.

## Requirements collection
The requirements for LinkedIn are defined below:

R1: Users should be able to add information to their profile including education, experiences, achievements, and skills.

R2: Users should be able to search for, and also view, pages, groups, and other users.

R3: Users should be able to send and cancel connection requests. They should also be able to respond to the connection requests of other users by either accepting or ignoring them.

R4: Users should be able to follow other users without adding them as their connection.

R5: Users should be able to view their number of connections, profile views, post impressions, and search appearances.

R6: Users should be able to request and give recommendations to other users.

R7: Users should be able to write a new post.

R8: Users should be able to react, share, and comment on a post. They should also be able to react or comment on an existing comment.

R9: A user should be able to send and receive messages from other users.

R10: The system should send a notification to the user to inform them about messages, connection requests, or comments on their post.
