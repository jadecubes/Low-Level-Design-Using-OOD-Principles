# Requirements for the Hotel Management System
In this lesson, we’ll list the requirements of the hotel management system. This is a very crucial step since requirements define the scope of a problem, so getting them right from the interviewer and understanding them well will make the design of the rest of the system smooth and easy.

We’ll use the notational convention to identify each requirement with a unique label "Rn", where "R" is short for Requirement and "n" is a natural number.

## Requirement collection
The requirements for the hotel management system are defined below:

R1: There can be four types of accounts in the system such as housekeeper, receptionist, guest, or server.

R2: The rooms can be of different styles like standard, deluxe, family suite, or business suite.

R3: The system should allow the guests to search for any room and book any of the available rooms.

R4: During room booking, the user will enter the check-in date and the duration of the stay. The user would also have to give some advance payment.

R5: The customer can cancel the booking and a full refund will be provided if the booking is canceled before 24 hours of the check-in time.

R6: The system should send a notification to the customers about the booking status or other information.

R7: All the housekeeping tasks should be logged in and managed by the system.

R8: The system should allow the customer to add services of their own choice like room service, food or kitchen service, or amenity.

R9: Every room should have its own specific key, and there can be a master key that opens a specific set of rooms.

R10: A hotel can have multiple branches of it.

We've identified our requirements for the problem, and in the next lesson, we will define different use cases for the hotel management system.
