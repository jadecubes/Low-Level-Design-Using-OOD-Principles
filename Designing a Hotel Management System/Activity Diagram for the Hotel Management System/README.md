# Activity Diagram for the Hotel Management System
Activities diagrams are a great way to visualize the flow of messages from one activity to the other in the system. There can be different activity diagrams that we can create for our hotel management system. In this lesson, weâ€™ll create activity diagrams for the following two activities:

- Hotel check-in

- Activity challenge: Cancel room booking


## Hotel check-in
The following are the states and actions that will be involved in this activity diagram.

### States
Initial state: A guest with a room booking comes to the hotel reception for check-in.

Final state: The guest successfully checked in at the hotel.

### Actions
The guest has a room booked and arrives at the hotel reception. The receptionist validates the booking and checks if the room is ready. The receptionist then issues room keys and updates the room status.

Based on the order above, the activity diagram of the hotel check-in is shown below.
