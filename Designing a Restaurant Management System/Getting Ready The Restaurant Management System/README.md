# Getting Ready: The Restaurant Management System
A restaurant management system (RMS) is a software program that helps restaurant owners and managers to handle and organize various aspects of their businesses including food and beverage sales, employee schedules, and customer reservations. The restaurant management system can be used in various settings, including quick-service and fine-dining restaurants, and cafeterias. The system allows restaurants to streamline their operations, improve efficiency, and better serve their customers.

RMS is used to manage various aspects of a restaurant efficiently and securely. The restaurant’s management can have control and flexibility over their operations from a single location using this system. The system enables the manager to monitor available tables, make reservations, and generate bills.

Overall, the goal of a restaurant management system is to help restaurant owners and managers to streamline and automate various tasks, allowing them to focus on providing a high-quality dining experience to their customers.

## Expectations from the interviewee
There are several components in a restaurant management system, each with specific constraints and requirements. The following provides an overview of some of the main expectations that the interviewer will want to hear you discuss in more detail, during the interview.

### Restaurant services
To better understand the services offered by a restaurant management system, you may ask the interviewer the following questions:

1. Does the restaurant provide a delivery service?

2. Can a customer place an online order?

3. Does the restaurant accept online/card payments?

### Restaurant management
Restaurant branches vary in terms of services, which is why it is important to clear the following questions from the interviewer:

1. Can branches vary in terms of the services of a restaurant?

2. Do we need to consider the inventory management of the restaurant for this problem?

## Design approach
We’ll design this restaurant management system using the bottom-up approach. Therefore, we’ll follow the steps below:

- Identify and design the smallest components first—the table, table seat, meal, meal item, and seating chart.

- Use these small components to design bigger components—the menu, branch, and restaurant.

- Repeat the steps above until we design the whole restaurant management system.

## Design patterns

It is always a good practice to discuss the design patterns that the restaurant management system falls under, during the interview. Stating the design patterns will give the interviewer a positive impression and shows that the interviewee is well-versed in the advanced concepts of object-oriented design.

The following design patterns are used to design the restaurant management system:

- The Singleton design pattern

- The Factory design pattern

Let's explore the requirements of the restaurant management system in the next lesson.
