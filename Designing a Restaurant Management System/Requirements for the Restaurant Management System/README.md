# Requirements for the Restaurant Management System
In this lesson, we’ll list the requirements of the restaurant management system design. This is a very crucial step, since requirements define the scope of a problem. Therefore, getting them right from the interviewer and understanding them well will make the design of the rest of the system smooth and easy.

We’ll use the notational convention to identify each requirement with a unique label, "Rn" where "R" is short for Requirement and "n" is a natural number.


## Requirement collection
R1: The restaurant can have multiple branches.

R2: Each branch will offer a menu with various sections and items.

R3: The waiter should be able to create an order for a table and add items for each person seated.

R4: Each person’s order can consist of multiple items, each corresponding to a menu item.

R5: The system should be able to provide information about tables currently available for walk-in customers.

R6: The system should allow for the reservation of tables.

R7: The receptionist should be able to search for available tables by date and time and make a reservation.

R8: The system should allow customers to make and cancel their reservations.

R9: The system should send notifications as the reservation time approaches.

R10: Customers should be able to pay their bills with credit cards, checks, or cash.

R11: Each branch may have different configurations of tables.

We've identified our requirements for the problem. In the next lesson, we’ll define different use cases of the restaurant management system.
