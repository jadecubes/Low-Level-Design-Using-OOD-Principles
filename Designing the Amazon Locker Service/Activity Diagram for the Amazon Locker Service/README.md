# Activity Diagram for the Amazon Locker Service
Activity diagrams are a great way to visualize the flow of messages from one activity to the other in the system. There can be different activity diagrams that we can create for our Amazon Locker system. In this lesson, we will create an activity diagram for the following activity.

## Product pickup
The states and actions that will be involved in this activity diagram are provided below.

### States
Initial state: A customer who has ordered a product from Amazon comes to the Amazon Locker to pick up the product.

Final state: The customer either successfully gets the product or the system shows an incorrect code error.

### Actions
The customer arrives at the Amazon Locker and enters the code. The system validates the code and opens the locker.

Based on the order above, the activity diagram of product pickup is given below:

In the next lesson, we will present the code for our designed classes in some of the most popular languages.
