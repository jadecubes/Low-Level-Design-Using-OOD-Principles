# Code of Jigsaw Puzzle
We’ve gone over the different aspects of the jigsaw puzzle and observed the attributes attached to the problem using various UML diagrams. Let’s explore the more practical side of things, where we will work on implementing the jigsaw puzzle using multiple languages. This is usually the last step in an object-oriented design interview process.

We have chosen the following languages to write the skeleton code of the different classes present in the jigsaw puzzle:

- Java

- C#

- Python

- C++

- JavaScript
