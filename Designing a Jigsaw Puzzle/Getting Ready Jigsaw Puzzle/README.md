# Getting Ready: Jigsaw Puzzle
## Problem definition
A jigsaw puzzle is a picture divided into irregularly shaped pieces that can be assembled together to form a complete picture. A puzzle has a fixed number of pieces that can only fit together in exactly one way. We can solve the jigsaw puzzle by aligning the pieces in a way that they fit with each other and also create a coherent picture.

## Expectations from the interviewee
Although the jigsaw problem is a simpler design problem asked in interviews, the interviewer still has some expectations. The following provides an overview of what the interviewer wants to hear you discuss in more detail during the interview.

### The puzzle board
You may want to ask the interviewer more about the kind of jigsaw puzzle. You can ask the following questions:

- What does a jigsaw puzzle look like. Is there a picture or a pattern on the puzzle?

- What type of shape does our board have? Is it rectangular, circular, or any other shape?

### The puzzle pieces
It is important to clarify the requirements for a single piece of the puzzle as it is a key feature of the problem. You can ask the following questions:

- What kind of shape do the puzzle pieces have? How many sides does a piece have?

- How do the pieces fit together?

- Will all the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle be unique?

## Design approach
We are going to design this jigsaw puzzle using the bottom-up design approach. For this, we will follow the steps below:

- Identify and design the smallest components first like the puzzle edges of a piece.

- Use these small components to design bigger components, for example, the puzzle piece.

- Repeat the steps above until we design the whole system, i.e., the puzzle board.

## Design pattern
It is always a good practice to discuss the design patterns that the jigsaw puzzle falls under, during the interview. Stating the design patterns will give the interviewer a positive impression and shows that the interviewee is well-versed in the advanced concepts of object-oriented design.

The following design pattern is used to design the jigsaw puzzle:

- Singleton design pattern

Note: The jigsaw puzzle design problem is a fairly simple problem for which we don’t need to create the use case, sequence, and activity diagrams. The set of requirements defined for this problem are not suitable for these diagrams.

Let’s explore the requirements of the jigsaw puzzle problem in the next lesson.
