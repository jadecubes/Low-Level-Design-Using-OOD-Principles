# Code for the Online Blackjack Game
We've covered different aspects of the Blackjack game and observed the attributes attached to the problem using various UML diagrams. Let us now explore the more practical side of things where we will work on implementing the Blackjack game using multiple languages. This is usually the last step in an object-oriented design interview process.

We have chosen the following languages to write the skeleton code of the different classes present in the Blackjack game:

- Java

- C#

- Python

- C++

- JavaScript

## Blackjack game classes
In this section, we will provide the skeleton code of the classes designed in the class diagram lesson.
```
Note: For simplicity, we are not defining getter and setter functions. The reader can assume that all class attributes are private and accessed through their respective public getter methods and modified only through their public method functions.
```
### Enumerations and custom data type
The following code provides the definition of the enumeration and custom data type used in the Blackjack game.

Suit: We need to create an enumeration to keep track of the suit of the card, whether it is diamond, spade, heart, or club.

AccountStatus: We need to create an enumeration to keep track of the status of the account, whether it is active, canceled, closed, blocked, or none.

The Person class is used as a custom data type. The implementation of the Person class can be found below:
```
Note: JavaScript does not support enumerations, so we will be using the Object.freeze() method as an alternative that freezes an object and prevents further modifications.
```

```java
// Enumeration
enum Suit {
  HEART,
  SPADE, 
  CLUB, 
  DIAMOND
}

enum AccountStatus {
  ACTIVE, 
  CLOSED, 
  CANCELED, 
  BLACKLISTED, 
  NONE
}

// Custom Person data type class
public class Person {
  private String name;
  private String streetAddress;
  private String city;
  private String state;
  private int zipCode;
  private String country;
}
        Definition of enums and custom datatypes
```

```c#
// Enumeration
enum Suit {
  HEART,
  SPADE, 
  CLUB, 
  DIAMOND
}

enum AccountStatus {
  ACTIVE, 
  CLOSED, 
  CANCELED, 
  BLACKLISTED, 
  NONE
}

// Custom Person data type class
class Person {
  private String name;

  HEART = 1
  SPADE = 2
  CLUB = 3
  DIAMOND = 4

class AccountStatus(enum.Enum):
  ACTIVE = 1
  CLOSED = 2
  CANCELED = 3
  BLACKLISTED = 4
  NONE = 5

# Custom Person data type class
class Person:

### Players
The Player is an abstract class and the BlackjackPlayer and Dealer classes extend the Player class.

- BlackjackPlayer: They place the first wager and update the stake with winning and losing sums. They can choose between the hit and stand options.

- Dealer: They are primarily in charge of dealing cards and following the Blackjack rules.

```java
public abstract class Player {
  private String id;
  private String password;
  private double balance;
  private AccountStatus status;
  private Person person;
  private Hand hand;

  public void addHand(Hand hand);
  public void removeHand(Hand hand);
  public abstract boolean resetPassword();
  public void addToHand(Hand hand);
}

public class BlackjackPlayer extends Player {
  private int bet;
  private int totalCash;

  public BlackjackPlayer(Hand hand);
  public void placeBet(int bet);
