# Code for the Parking Lot
We’ve gone over the different aspects of the parking lot system and observed the attributes attached to the problem using various UML diagrams. Let’s explore the more practical side of things, where we will work on implementing the parking lot system using multiple languages. This is usually the last step in an object-oriented design interview process.

We have chosen the following languages to write the skeleton code of the different classes present in the parking lot system:

- Java

- C#

- Python

- C++

- JavaScript

## Parking lot classes
In this section, we will provide the skeleton code of the classes designed in the class diagram lesson.
```
Note: For simplicity, we aren’t defining getter and setter functions. The reader can assume that all class attributes are private and accessed through their respective public getter methods and modified only through their public method functions.
```

### Enumerations and custom data type
First of all, we will define all the enumerations required in the parking lot. According to the class diagram, there are two enumerations used in the system i.e., PaymentStatus and AccountStatus. The code to implement these enumerations and custom data types is as follows:
```
enumerations: A special data type which contains a set of predefined constants.
```

```
Note: JavaScript does not support enumerations, so we will be using the Object.freeze() method as an alternative that freezes an object and prevents further modifications.
```
```java
// Enumeration
enum PaymentStatus {
  COMPLETED, 
  FAILED, 
  PENDING, 
  UNPAID, 
  REFUNDED
}

enum AccountStatus {
  ACTIVE, 
  CLOSED, 
  CANCELED, 
  BLACKLISTED, 
  NONE
}

// Custom Person data type class
public class Person {
  private String name;
  private String address;
  private String phone;
  private String email;
}

// Custom Address data type class
public class Address {
  private int zipCode;
  private String address;
  private String city;
  private String state;
  private String country;
}
                    Definition for the constants
```

```c#
// Enumeration
enum PaymentStatus {
  COMPLETED, 
  FAILED, 
  PENDING, 
  UNPAID, 
  REFUNDED
}

enum AccountStatus {
  ACTIVE, 
  CLOSED, 
  CANCELED, 
  BLACKLISTED, 
  NONE
}

// Custom Person data type class
class Person {
  private string name;

}

// Custom Address data type class
class Address {
  private int zipCode;
  private string address;
  private string city;
  private string state;
  private string country;
}
                       Definitions for constants
```

```python
// Enumeration
enum PaymentStatus {
  COMPLETED, 
  FAILED, 
  PENDING, 
  UNPAID, 
  REFUNDED
}

enum AccountStatus {

}
                  Definitions for constants
```
```c++

}
                    Definitions for constants
```

  private string address;
  private string city;
  private string state;
  private string country;
}
                      Definitions for constants
```
### Parking spots
The first section of the parking lot system that we will work on is the ParkingSpot class, which will act as a base class for four different types of parking spots: handicapped, compact, large, and motorcycle. This will have an instance of the Vehicle class. The definition of the ParkingSpot class and the classes being derived from it are given below:
```java
// ParkingSpot is an abstract class
public abstract class ParkingSpot {
  private int id;
  private boolean isFree;
  private Vehicle vehicle;

  public boolean getIsFree();
  public abstract boolean assignVehicle(Vehicle vehicle);
  public boolean removeVehicle();
}

public class Handicapped extends ParkingSpot {
  public boolean assignVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
    // definition
  }
}

public class Compact extends ParkingSpot {
  public boolean assignVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
    // definition
  }
}

public class Large extends ParkingSpot {
  public boolean assignVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
    // definition
  }
}

public class Motorcycle extends ParkingSpot {
  public boolean assignVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
    // definition
  }
}
                ParkingSpot and its derived classes
```

```c#
// ParkingSpot is an abstract class
public abstract class ParkingSpot {
    private int id;
    private bool isFree;
    private Vehicle vehicle; 

    public bool GetIsFree(); 
    public abstract bool AssignVehicle(Vehicle vehicle); 
    public bool RemoveVehicle(); 
}

class Handicapped : ParkingSpot {
    public override bool AssignVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        // definition
    }
}

    public override bool AssignVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        // definition
    }
}

class Large : ParkingSpot {
    public override bool AssignVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        // definition
    }
}

class Motorcycle : ParkingSpot {
    public override bool AssignVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        // definition
    }

### Display board and parking rate
This section contains the DisplayBoard and ParkingRate classes that only have the composition class with the ParkingLot class. This relationship is highlighted in the ParkingLot class. The definition of these classes is given below:
```java
public class DisplayBoard {
  // Data members
  private int id;
  private <List>Handicapped handicappedSpot;
  private <List>Compact compactSpot;
  private <List>Large largeSpot;
  private <List>MotorCycle motorCycleSpot;

  public void showFreeSlot();
}

public class ParkingRate {
  // Data members
  private double hours;
  private double rate;

  // Member function
  public void calculate();
}
   The DisplayBoard and ParkingRate classes
```

```c$

    #id;
    #handicapped;
    #compact;
    #large;
    #motorCycle;

    constructor(id, handicappedSpot, compactSpot, largeSpot, motorCycleSpot) {

        this.#compact = new Array(); 
        this.#large = new Array();  
        this.#motorCycle = new Array();  
    }

    // Member functions
    showFreeSlot() {}
}

class ParkinRate {
    // Data members
    #id;
    #hours;
    #rate;
    constructor(id, hours, rate) {
        this.#id = id;
        this.#hours = hours;
        this.#rate = rate;
    }

    // Member function
    calculate() {}
}
           The DisplayBoard and ParkingRate classes
```


### Entrance and exit
This section contains the Entrance and Exit classes, both of which are associated with the ParkingTicket class. The definition of the Entrance and Exit classes is given below:
```java
public class Entrance {
  // Data members 
  private int id;
  private ParkingTicket ticket;

  // Member function
  public ParkingTicket getTicket(ParkingTicket ticket);
}

public class Exit {
  // Data members 
  private int id;
  private ParkingTicket ticket;

  // Member function
  public void validateTicket(ParkingTicket ticket);
}
       The Entrance and Exit classes
```

```c#
class Entrance {
    // Data members 
    private int id;
    private ParkingTicket ticket; 

    // Member function
    public ParkingTicket GetTicket(ParkingTicket ticket); 
}

class Exit {
    // Data members 
    private int id;
    private ParkingTicket ticket; 

    // Member function
    public void ValidateTicket(ParkingTicket ticket);

  def validate_ticket(self, ticket):
    pass
                 The Entrance and Exit classes
```

```c++
class Entrance {
  // Data members 
  private:
    int id;
    ParkingTicket ticket; 

  // Member function
  public:
    ParkingTicket getTicket(ParkingTicket ticket); 
};

class Exit {
  // Data members 
  private:
    int id;
    ParkingTicket ticket; 

  // Member function

    constructor(id, ticket) {
        this.#id = id;
        this.#ticket = ticket; // Refers to an instance of the ParktingTicket class
    }

    // ticket here refers to an instance of the ParktingTicket class
    validateTicket(ticket){ }
}
               The Entrance and Exit classes
```

### Parking ticket
The definition of the ParkingTicket class can be found below. This contains instancesof the Vehicle, Payment, Entrance and Exit classes:
```java
public class ParkingTicket {
    private int ticketNo;
    private Date timestamp;
    private Date exit;
    private double amount;
    private boolean status;

    // Following are the instances of their respective classes
    private Vehicle vehicle;
    private Payment payment;
    private Entrance entrance;
    private Exit exitIns;    
}
        The ParkingTicket class
```

```c#
public class ParkingTicket {
    private int ticketNo;
    private DateTime timestamp;
    private DateTime exit;
    private double amount;
    private bool status;
    
    // Following are the instances of their respective classes
    private Vehicle vehicle;
    private Payment payment;
    private Entrance entrance;
    private Exit exitIns;    
}
          The ParkingTicket class
```

```python
class ParkingTicket:
  def __init__(self, ticket_no, timestamp, exit, amount, status, vehicle, payment, entrance, exit_ins):
    self.__ticket_no = ticket_no
    self.__timestamp = timestamp
    self.__exit = exit
    self.__amount = amount
    self.__status = status
    
    # Following are the instances of their respective classes
    self__vehicle = vehicle
    self__payment = payment
    self__entrance = entrance
    self__exit_ins = exit_ins
     
     The ParkingTicket class
```

```c++
class ParkingTicket {
  private: 
    int ticketNo;
    time_t timestamp;
    time_t exit;
    double amount;
    bool status;
  
    // Following are the instances of their respective classes
    Vehicle vehicle;
    Payment payment;
    Entrance entrance;
    Exit exitIns;    
};

              The ParkingTicket class
```

```javascript
class ParkingTicket{
    #ticketNo;
    #timestamp;
    #exit;
    #amount;
    #status;
    #vehicle;
    #payment;
    #entrance;
    #exitIns;

    constructor(ticketNo, timestamp, exit,amount, status, vehicle, payment, entrance, exitIns) {
        this.#ticketNo = ticketNo;
        this.#timestamp = timestamp;
        this.#exit = exit;
        this.#amount = amount;
        this.#status = status;

        // Following are the instances of their respective classes
        this.#vehicle = vehicle;
        this.#payment = payment;
        this.#entrance = entrance;
        this.#exitIns = exitIns;
    }
}
                 The ParkingTicket class
```

### Payment
The Payment class is another abstract class, with the Cash and CreditCard classes as its child. This takes the PaymentStatus enumeration and the dateTime data type to keep track of the payment status and time. The definition of this class is given below

```java
// Payment is an abstract class
public abstract class Payment {
    private double amount;
    private PaymentStatus status;
    private Date timestamp;

    public abstract boolean initiateTransaction();
}

public class Cash extends Payment {
    public boolean initiateTransaction() {
        // definition
    }
}

public class CreditCard extends Payment {
    public boolean initiateTransaction() {
        // definition
    }
}
        Payment and its derived classes
```

```c#
// Payment is an abstract class
public abstract class Payment {
    private double amount;
    private PaymentStatus status;
    private DateTime timestamp;
    public abstract bool InitiateTransaction();
}

class Cash : Payment {
    public override bool InitiateTransaction() {
        // definition
    }
}

class CreditCard : Payment {
    public override bool InitiateTransaction() {
        // definition
    }
}
            Payment and its derived classes
```

```python
# Payment is an abstract class
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Payment(ABC):
  def __init__(self, amount, status, timestamp):
    self.__amount = amount
    self.__status = status # Refers to the PaymentStatus enum
    self.__timestamp = timestamp

  @abstractmethod
  def initiate_transaction(self):
    pass

class Cash(Payment):
  def __init__(self, amount, status, timestamp):
    super().__init__(amount, status, timestamp)

  def initiate_transaction(self):
    pass

class CreditCard(Payment):
  def __init__(self, amount, status, timestamp):
    super().__init__(amount, status, timestamp)

  def initiate_transaction(self):
    pass
          Payment and its derived classes
```

```c++
// Payment is an abstract class
class Payment {
    private:
        double amount;
        PaymentStatus status;
        time_t timestamp;

    public virtual bool initiateTransaction() = 0;
};

class Cash : public Payment {
    public bool initiateTransaction() {
        // definition
    }
};

class CreditCard : public Payment {
    public bool initiateTransaction() {
        // definition
    }
};
      Payment and its derived classes
```

```javascript
// Payment is an abstract class
class Payment {
    #amount;
    #status;
    #timestamp;

    constructor(amount, status, timestamp) {
        if (this.constructor == Payment) {
            throw new Error("Abstract classes can't be instantiated.");
        }
        else {
            this.#amount = amount;
            this.#status = status; // Refers to the PaymentStatus enum
            this.#timestamp = timestamp;
        }
    }
    initiateTransaction() { }
}
class Cash extends Payment{
    initiateTransaction(){
        // definition
    }
}
class CreditCard extends Payment{
    initiateTransaction(){
        // definition
    }
}

           Payment and its derived classes
```
### Parking lot
The final class of the parking lot system is the ParkingLot class which will be a Singleton class, meaning the entire system will only have one instance of this class. The definition of this class is given below:

```java
public class ParkingLot {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private String address;
    private ParkingRate parkingRate;

    private HashMap<String, Entrance> entrance;
    private HashMap<String, Exit> exit;

    // Create a hashmap that identifies all currently generated tickets using their ticket number
    private HashMap<String, ParkingTicket> tickets;

    // The ParkingLot is a singleton class that ensures it will have only one active instance at a time
    // Both the Entrance and Exit classes use this class to create and close parking tickets
    private static ParkingLot parkingLot = null;

    // Created a private constructor to add a restriction (due to Singleton)
    private ParkingLot() {
        // Call the name, address, parking_rate elements of the customer in the parking lot from the database
        // Create initial entrance and exit hashmaps respectively
    }

    // Created a static method to access the singleton instance of ParkingLot
    public static ParkingLot getInstance() {
        if (parkingLot == null) {
            parkingLot = new ParkingLot();
        }
        return parkingLot;
    }

    public boolean addEntrance(Entrance entrance){}
    public boolean addExit(Exit exit){}

    // This function allows parking tickets to be available at multiple entrances
    public ParkingTicket getParkingTicket(Vehicle vehicle) {}

    public boolean isFull(ParkingSpot type){}

    public static ParkingLot GetInstance() {
        get {
            if (parkingLot == null) {
                parkingLot = new ParkingLot();
            }
            return parkingLot;
        }
    }

    public bool AddEntrance(Entrance entrance) {}
    public bool AddExit(Exit exit) {}

    // This function allows parking tickets to be available at multiple entrances
    public ParkingTicket GetParkingTicket(Vehicle vehicle) {}

## Wrapping up
We've explored the complete design of a parking lot system in this chapter. We've looked at how a basic parking lot system can be visualized using various UML diagrams and designed using object-oriented principles and design patterns.
