# Activity Diagram for the Movie Ticket Booking System
An activity diagram is a great way to visualize the flow of messages from one activity to the other in the system. There can be different activity diagrams that we can create for our movie ticket booking system. In this lesson, we will create activity diagrams for the following two activities:

- The customer makes a booking for the movie.

- Activity challenge: The admin cancels a show.

## The customer makes a booking for the movie
The following are the states and actions that will be involved in this activity diagram.

### States
Initial state: The customer opens a search for a movie.

Final state: The customer receives a ticket for the movie.

### Actions
The customer searches for a movie by specific criteria and selects their movie. The customer then selects their required seat and pays according to their seat type. The payment is carried out either through cash or a credit card. After successful payment, the customer receives the movie ticket.

Based on the order above, the activity diagram of a customer making a booking for the movie is given below.
```
Note: Here we assume that the customer is purchasing a single cinema seat.
